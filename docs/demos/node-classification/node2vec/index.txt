Node classification using Node2Vec [1]
======================================

This folder contains two `Jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>`_ python notebooks demonstrating the combined use of
``stellargraph`` (this library), ``Gensim`` [4], and ``Scikit-learn`` [3] libraries for node classification in a
homogeneous graph.

The examples demonstrate how to calculate node embedding vectors in just a few lines of Python code using the
``Node2Vec`` [1] algorithm on both weighted and unweighted graphs.

The learned node representations are then used in a node classification task. Specifically, the example demonstrates
how to predict the subject of a research paper given a paper citation network. The latter is a homogeneous graph
with nodes representing research papers that have a single attribute, namely the subject of the paper. Links in the
graph represent a citation relationship between two papers, i.e., ``paper A`` cites ``paper B``. The graph is
treated as undirected.
