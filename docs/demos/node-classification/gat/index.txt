GAT for Node Classification
===========================

This is an example of using the Graph Attention network (GAT) algorithm [1] for semi-supervised node classification
in a homogeneous network.

Requirements
------------

All examples use Python 3.6 and the StellarGraph library. To install the StellarGraph library
follow the instructions at: https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph

Additional requirements are Pandas, Numpy and Scikit-Learn which are installed as depdendencies
of the StellarGraph library. In addition Juptyer is required to run the notebook version of
the example.

Running the notebook
--------------------

The same example is also available as a Juptyer notebook. To use this install Jupyter to the
same Python 3.6 environment as StellarGraph, following the instructions on the Jupyter project
website: http://jupyter.org/install.html

After starting the Jupyter server on your computer, load the notebook
``gat-cora-node-classification-example.ipynb`` and follow the instructions inside.
