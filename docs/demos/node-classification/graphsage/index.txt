GraphSAGE Node Classification
=============================

This folder includes two examples of using the GraphSAGE algorithm [1] for semi-supervised node classification in
homogeneous networks.

The first example demonstrates transductive node classification using the Cora citation network. This demo is included
as the Python script ``graphsage-cora-example.py`` and as the Jupyter
notebook ``graphsage-cora-node-classification-example.ipynb``.

The second example demonstrates inductive representation learning and node classification using the Pubmed-Diabetes
paper citation network. This demo is included in the Jupyter notebook
``graphsage-pubmed-inductive-node-classification-example.ipynb``.

The two Jupyter notebooks include all the information for downloading the corresponding datasets, training the GraphSAGE
models and using them to classify nodes with unknown (to the training algorithm) labels.

To run the notebooks install Jupyter to the same Python 3.6 environment as StellarGraph, following the instructions on
the Jupyter project website: http://jupyter.org/install.html

After starting the Jupyter server on your computer, load either of the two notebooks and follow the instructions inside.

Requirements
------------

All examples use Python 3.6 and the StellarGraph library. To install the StellarGraph library
follow the instructions at: https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph

Additional requirements are Pandas, Numpy and Scikit-Learn which are installed as depdendencies
of the StellarGraph library. In addition Juptyer is required to run the notebook version of
the example.

CORA dataset
------------

Currently the examples in this directory are tested on the CORA dataset. The GraphSAGE model assumes that node
features are available for all nodes in the graph.
