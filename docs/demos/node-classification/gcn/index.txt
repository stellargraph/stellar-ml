GCN for Node Classification
===========================

This is an example of using the Graph Convolutional network (GCN) algorithm [1] for semi-supervised node classification
in a homogeneous network.

Requirements
------------

All examples use Python 3.6 and the StellarGraph library. To install the StellarGraph library
follow the instructions at: https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph

Additional requirements are Pandas, Numpy and Scikit-Learn which are installed as depdendencies
of the StellarGraph library.
