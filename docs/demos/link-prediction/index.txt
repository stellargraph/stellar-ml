Link prediction
==================================

`StellarGraph <https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph>`_ provides numerous algorithms for doing link prediction on graphs. This folder contains demos of all of them to explain how they work and how to use them as part of a TensorFlow Keras data science workflow.

A link prediction task predicts an attribute of links/edges in a graph. For instance, predicting whether a link/edge that isn't already in the graph should exist (binary classification, or recommendation, or knowledge base completion, in a knowledge graph), or even labelling existing links with a categorical class (binary classification or multiclass classification), or predicting a continuous number (regression). It is supervised or semi-supervised, where the model is trained using a subset of links/edges that have ground-truth labels. For predicting edge existence, the ground-truth may just be whether the edge exists in the original data, rather than a separate label.

Link prediction can also be done as a downstream task from node representation learning/embeddings, by combining node embedding vectors for the source and target nodes of the edge and training a supervised or semi-supervised classifier against the result. Unsupervised algorithms that can be used in this manner include random walk-based methods like Metapath2Vec. StellarGraph provides :doc:`demos of unsupervised algorithms <../embeddings/index>`.
