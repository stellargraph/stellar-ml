Hinsage Recommender -- Movielens Example
========================================

This is an example of using Heterogeneous GraphSAGE [1] (HinSAGE) as a hybrid recommender
system, predicting user-movie ratings for the Movielens dataset.

Requirements
------------

This example assumes the ``stellargraph`` library and its requirements have been
installed by following the installation instructions in the README
of the library's `root directory <https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph>`_.

MovieLens Data
--------------

The MovieLens data contains a bipartite graph of Movies and Users, and edges
between them denoting reviews with scores ranging from 1 to 5.

Getting the data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The data for this example is the MovieLens dataset of movie ratings
collected from the MovieLens web site (http://movielens.org).
The dataset of 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1682 movies
can be downloaded from `this link <https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/>`_.

To run the examples, extract the data into a directory,
and adjust the command line below to have ``--data_path`` pointing
to the data directory.

Running the notebook
--------------------

The narrated version of this example is available in the ``movielens-recommender.ipynb`` notebook.
To run through the notebook, you need to launch jupyter notebook:


* Activate the python 3.6 environment in which the
  ``stellargraph`` library is installed
* Run the following command ``jupyter-notebook``, and note the ip address and port
  number at which is it listening (normally it should be http://127.0.0.1:8888/)

  * note: you may need to first install ``jupyter`` by running ``pip install jupyter`` in your python environment

* Copy-paste the ip address obtained in the previous step into your browser. You should see
  a directory structure of the ``stellargraph`` library.
* Navigate to ``/demos/link-prediction-hinsage/movielens-recommender.ipynb``, and click on
  it to launch the notebook.
