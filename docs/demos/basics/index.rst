StellarGraph basics
===================

`StellarGraph <https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph>`_ has support for loading data via Pandas, NetworkX and Neo4j. This folder contains examples of the loading data into a ``StellarGraph`` object, which is the format used by the machine learning algorithms in this library.
