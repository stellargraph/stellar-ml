# Change Log
## [0.6.1](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/tree/v0.6.1) (1 Apr 2019)

**Fixed bugs:**
- a bug in passing graph adjacency matrix to the optional `func_opt` function in `FullBatchNodeGenerator` class
- a bug in `demos/node-classification/gcn/gcn-cora-example.py:144`: incorrect argument was used to pass
the optional function to the generator for GCN

**Enhancements:**
- separate treatment of `gcn` and `gat` models in `demos/ensembles/ensemble-node-classification-example.ipynb`
