# Change Log

## [HEAD](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/tree/HEAD)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/compare/v0.10.0...HEAD)

### Major features and improvements

- New algorithms:
  - Watch Your Step: computes node embeddings by simulating the effect of random walks, rather than doing them. [\#750](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/750).
  - Deep Graph Infomax: performs unsupervised node representation learning [\#978](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/978).

### Breaking changes

- `StellarGraph.to_networkx` parameters now use `attr` to refer to NetworkX attributes, not `name` or `label` [\#973](http://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/973). Migration: for any named parameters in `graph.to_networkx(...)`, change `node_type_name=...` to `node_type_attr=...` and similarly `edge_type_name` to `edge_type_attr`, `edge_weight_label` to `edge_weight_attr`, `feature_name` to `feature_attr`.

### Experimental features

Some new algorithms and features are still under active development, and are available as an experimental preview. However, they may not be easy to use: their documentation or testing may be incomplete, and they may change dramatically from release to release. The experimental status is noted in the documentation and at runtime via prominent warnings.

- DistMult: computes embeddings for nodes and edge types in knowledge graphs, and use these to perform link prediction [\#755](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/755). The implementation hasn't been validated to match the paper.
- GCNSupervisedGraphClassification: supervised graph classification model based on Graph Convolutional layers (GCN) [\#929](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/929).
- Deep Graph Infomax: performs unsupervised node representation learning [\#978](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/978) The implementation is not fully tested.

### Bug fixes and other changes

- `StellarGraph.to_adjacency_matrix` is at least 15Ã— faster on undirected graphs [\#932](http://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/932)
- DevOps changes:

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/tree/v0.10.0)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/compare/v0.9.0...v0.10.0)

### Major features and improvements

- The `StellarGraph` and `StellarDiGraph` classes are now backed by NumPy and Pandas [\#752](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/752). The `StellarGraph(...)` and `StellarDiGraph(...)` constructors now consume Pandas DataFrames representing node features and the edge list. This significantly reduces the memory use and construction time for these `StellarGraph` objects.

  The following table shows some measurements of the memory use of `g = StellarGraph(...)`, and the time required for that constructor call, for several real-world datasets of different sizes, for both the old form backed by NetworkX code and the new form backed by NumPy and Pandas (both old and new store node features similarly, using 2D NumPy arrays, so the measurements in this table include only graph structure: the edges and nodes themselves):

  | dataset |  nodes |    edges | size old (MiB) | size new (MiB) | size change | time old (s) | time new (s) | time change |
  |---------|-------:|---------:|---------------:|---------------:|------------:|-------------:|-------------:|------------:|
  | Cora    |   2708 |     5429 |            4.1 |        **1.3** |    **-69%** |        0.069 |    **0.034** |    **-50%** |
  | FB15k   |  14951 |   592213 |            148 |         **28** |    **-81%** |          5.5 |      **1.2** |    **-77%** |
  | Reddit  | 231443 | 11606919 |           6611 |        **493** |    **-93%** |          154 |       **33** |    **-82%** |

  The old backend has been removed, and conversion from a NetworkX graph should be performed via the `StellarGraph.from_networkx` function (the existing form `StellarGraph(networkx_graph)` is supported in this release but is deprecated, and may be removed in a future release).
- More detailed information about Heterogeneous GraphSAGE (HinSAGE) has been added to StellarGraph's readthedocs documentation [\#839](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/839).
- New algorithms:
  - Link prediction with directed GraphSAGE, via `DirectedGraphSAGELinkGenerator` [\#871](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/871)
  - GraphWave: computes structural node embeddings by using wavelet transforms on the graph Laplacian [\#822](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/822)

### Breaking changes

- Some layers and models had many parameters move from `**kwargs` to real arguments: `GraphConvolution`, `GCN`. [\#801](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/801) Invalid (e.g. incorrectly spelled) arguments would have been ignored previously, but now may fail with a `TypeError`; to fix, remove or correct the arguments.
- The `stellargraph.data.load_dataset_BlogCatalog3` function has been replaced by the `load` method on `stellargraph.datasets.BlogCatalog3` [\#888](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/888). Migration: replace `load_dataset_BlogCatalog3(location)` with `BlogCatalog3().load()`; code required to find the location or download the dataset can be removed, as `load` now does this automatically.
- `stellargraph.data.train_test_val_split` and `stellargraph.data.NodeSplitter` have been removed. [\#887](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/887) Migration: this functionality should be replaced with `pandas` and `sklearn` (for instance, `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`).
- Most of the submodules in `stellargraph.utils` have been moved to top-level modules: `stellargraph.calibration`, `stellargraph.ensemble`, `stellargraph.losses` and `stellargraph.interpretability` [\#938](http://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/938). Imports from the old location are now deprecated, and may stop working in future releases. See the linked issue for the full list of changes.

### Experimental features

Some new algorithms and features are still under active development, and are available as an experimental preview. However, they may not be easy to use: their documentation or testing may be incomplete, and they may change dramatically from release to release. The experimental status is noted in the documentation and at runtime via prominent warnings.

- Temporal Random Walks: random walks that respect the time that each edge occurred (stored as edge weights) [\#787](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/787). The implementation does not have an example or thorough testing and documentation.
- Watch Your Step: computes node embeddings by simulating the effect of random walks, rather than doing them. [\#750](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/750). The implementation is not fully tested.
- ComplEx: computes embeddings for nodes and edge types in knowledge graphs, and use these to perform link prediction [\#756](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/756). The implementation hasn't been validated to match the paper.
- Neo4j connector: the GraphSAGE algorithm can execute doing neighbourhood sampling in a Neo4j database, so that the edges of a graph do not have to fit entirely into memory [\#799](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/799). The implementation is not automatically tested, and doesn't support functionality like loading node feature vectors from Neo4j.

### Bug fixes and other changes

- StellarGraph now supports [TensorFlow 2.1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.1.0), which includes GPU support by default: [\#875](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/875)
- Demos now focus on Jupyter notebooks, and demo scripts that duplicate notebooks have been removed: [\#889](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/889)
- The following algorithms are now reproducible:
  - Supervised GraphSAGE Node Attribute Inference [\#844](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/844)
  - GraphSAGE Link Prediction [\#925](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/925)
- Randomness can be more easily controlled using `stellargraph.random.set_seed` [\#806](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/806)
- `StellarGraph.edges()` can return edge weights as a separate NumPy array with `include_edge_weights=True` [\#754](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/754)
- `StellarGraph.to_networkx` supports ignoring node features (and thus being a little more efficient) with `feature_name=None` [\#841](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/841)
- `StellarGraph.to_adjacency_matrix` now ignores edge weights (that is, defaults every weight to `1`) by default, unless `weighted=True` is specified [\#857](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/857)
- `stellargraph.utils.plot_history` visualises the model training history as a plot for each metric (such as loss) [\#902](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/902)
- the saliency maps/interpretability code has been refactored to have more sharing as well as to make it cleaner and easier to extend [\#855](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/855)
- DevOps changes:
  - Most demo notebooks are now tested on CI using Papermill, and so won't become out of date [\#575](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/575)
  - CI: [\#698](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/698), [\#760](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/760), [\#788](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/788), [\#817](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/817), [\#860](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/860), [\#874](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/874), [\#877](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/877), [\#878](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/878), [\#906](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/906), [\#908](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/908), [\#915](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/915), [\#916](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/916), [\#918](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/918)
  - Other: [\#708](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/708), [\#746](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/746), [\#791](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/791)


## [0.9.0](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/tree/v0.9.0)

### Major features and improvements

- StellarGraph is now available as [a conda package on Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/stellargraph/stellargraph) [\#516](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/516)
- New algorithms:
  - Cluster-GCN: an extension of GCN that can be trained using SGD, with demo [\#487](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/487)
  - Relational-GCN (RGCN): a generalisation of GCN to relational/multi edge type graphs, with demo [\#490](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/490)
  - Link prediction for full-batch models: `FullBatchLinkGenerator` allows doing link prediction with algorithms like GCN, GAT, APPNP and PPNP [\#543](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/543)
- Unsupervised GraphSAGE has now been updated and tested for reproducibility. Ensuring all seeds are set, running the same pipeline should give reproducible embeddings. [\#620](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/620)
- A `datasets` subpackage provides easier access to sample datasets with inbuilt downloading. [\#690](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/690)


### Breaking changes

- The stellargraph library now only supports `tensorflow` version 2.0 [\#518](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/518), [\#732](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/732). Backward compatibility with earlier versions of `tensorflow` is not guaranteed.
- The stellargraph library now only supports Python versions 3.6 and above [\#641](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/641). Backward compatibility with earlier versions of Python is not guaranteed.
- The `StellarGraph` class no longer exposes `NetworkX` internals, only required functionality. In particular, calls like `list(G)` will no longer return a list of nodes; use `G.nodes()` instead. [\#297](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/297) If NetworkX functionality is required, use the new `.to_networkx()` method to convert to a normal `networkx.MultiGraph` or `networkx.MultiDiGraph`.
- Passing a `NodeSequence` or `LinkSequence` object to `GraphSAGE` and `HinSAGE` classes is now deprecated and no longer supported [\#498](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/498). Users might need to update their calls of `GraphSAGE` and `HinSAGE` classes by passing `generator` objects instead of `generator.flow()` objects.
- Various methods on `StellarGraph` have been renamed to be more succinct and uniform:
   - `get_feature_for_nodes` is now `node_features`
   - `type_for_node` is now `node_type`
- Neighbourhood methods in `StellarGraph` class (`neighbors`, `in_nodes`, `out_nodes`) now return a list of neighbours instead of a set. This addresses [\#653](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/653). This means multi-edges are no longer collapsed into one in the return value. There will be an implicit change in behaviour for explorer classes used for algorithms like GraphSAGE, Node2Vec, since a neighbour connected via multiple edges will now be more likely to be sampled. If this doesn't sound like the desired behaviour, consider pruning the graph of multi-edges before running the algorithm.
- `GraphSchema` has been simplified to remove type look-ups for individual nodes and edges [\#702](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/702) [\#703](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/703). Migration: for nodes, use `StellarGraph.node_type`; for edges, use the `triple` argument to the `edges` method, or filter when doing neighbour queries using the `edge_types` argument.
- `NodeAttributeSpecification` and the supporting `Converter` classes have been removed [\#707](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/707). Migration: use the more powerful and flexible preprocessing tools from pandas and sklearn (see the linked PR for specifics)

### Experimental features

Some new algorithms and features are still under active development, and are available as an experimental preview. However, they may not be easy to use: their documentation or testing may be incomplete, and they may change dramatically from release to release. The experimental status is noted in the documentation and at runtime via prominent warnings.

- The `StellarGraph` and `StellarDiGraph` classes supports using a backend based on NumPy and Pandas that uses dramatically less memory for large graphs than the existing NetworkX-based backend [\#668](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/668). The new backend can be enabled by constructing with `StellarGraph(nodes=..., edges=...)` using Pandas DataFrames, instead of a NetworkX graph.

### Bug fixes and other changes

- Documentation for every relased version is published under a permanent URL, in addition to the `stable` alias for the latest release, e.g. <https://stellargraph.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.4/> for `v0.8.4` [#612](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/612)
- Neighbourhood methods in `StellarGraph` class (`neighbors`, `in_nodes`, `out_nodes`) now support additional parameters to include edge weights in the results or filter by a set of edge types. [\#646](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/646)
- Changed `GraphSAGE` and `HinSAGE` class API to accept generator objects the same as GCN/GAT models. Passing a `NodeSequence` or `LinkSequence` object is now deprecated.  [\#498](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/498)
- `SampledBreadthFirstWalk`, `SampledHeterogeneousBreadthFirstWalk` and `DirectedBreadthFirstNeighbours` have been made 1.2-1.5Ã— faster [\#628](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/628)
- `UniformRandomWalk` has been made 2Ã— faster [\#625](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/625)
- `FullBatchNodeGenerator.flow` has been reduced from `O(n^2)` quadratic complexity to `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph, making it orders of magnitude faster for large graphs [\#513](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/513)
- The dependencies required for demos and testing have been included as "extras" in the main package: `demos` and `igraph` for demos, and `test` for testing. For example, `pip install stellargraph[demos,igraph]` will install the dependencies required to run every demo. [\#661](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/661)
- The `StellarGraph` and `StellarDiGraph` constructors now list their arguments explicitly for clearer documentation (rather than using `*arg` and `**kwargs` splats) [\#659](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/659)
- `sys.exit(0)` is no longer called on failure in `load_dataset_BlogCatalog3` [\#648](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/648)
- Warnings are printed using the Python `warnings` module [\#583](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/583)

- Added build\(\) method for GraphSAGE and HinSAGE model classes [\#385](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/385)
This replaces the node_model\(\) and link_model\(\) methods, which will be deprecated in future versions (deprecation warnings added).
- Changed the `FullBatchNodeGenerator` to accept simpler `method` and `transform` arguments [\#405](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/405)


**Fixed bugs:**
- Removed label from features for pubmed dataset. [\#362](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/362)
- Python igraph requirement fixed [\#392](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/392)
- Simplified random walks to not require passing a graph [\#408](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/408)


## [0.6.1](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/tree/v0.6.1) (1 Apr 2019)

**Fixed bugs:**
- a bug in passing graph adjacency matrix to the optional `func_opt` function in `FullBatchNodeGenerator` class
- a bug in `demos/node-classification/gcn/gcn-cora-example.py:144`: incorrect argument was used to pass
the optional function to the generator for GCN

**Enhancements:**
- separate treatment of `gcn` and `gat` models in `demos/ensembles/ensemble-node-classification-example.ipynb`
