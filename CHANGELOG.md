# Change Log

## [HEAD](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/tree/HEAD)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/compare/HEAD...v0.8.2)

**New algorithms:**

- Cluster-GCN algorithm (an extension of GCN that can be trained using SGD) + demo [\#487](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/487)

**Implemented enhancements:** 

**Refactoring:**
- Changed `GraphSAGE` and `HinSAGE` class API to accept generator objects the same as GCN/GAT models. Passing a `NodeSequence` or `LinkSequence` object is now deprecated.  [\#498](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/498)

**Breaking changes:**
- Passing a `NodeSequence` or `LinkSequence` object to `GraphSAGE` and `HinSAGE` classes is now deprecated and no longer supported [\#498](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/498).
Users might need to update their calls of `GraphSAGE` and `HinSAGE` classes by passing `generator` objects instead of `generator.flow()` objects.

**Fixed bugs:**
