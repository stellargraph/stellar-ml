class FullBatchNodeGenerator:
    """
    A data generator for use with full-batch models on homogeneous graphs,
    e.g., GCN, GAT, SGC.
    The supplied graph G should be a StellarGraph object that is ready for
    machine learning. Currently the model requires node features to be available for all
    nodes in the graph.
    Use the :meth:`flow` method supplying the nodes and (optionally) targets
    to get an object that can be used as a Keras data generator.

    This generator will supply the features array and the adjacency matrix to a
    full-batch Keras graph ML model.  There is a choice to supply either a sparse
    adjacency matrix (the default) or a dense adjacency matrix, with the `sparse`
    argument.

    For these algorithms the adjacency matrix requires pre-processing and the
    'method' option should be specified with the correct pre-processing for
    each algorithm. The options are as follows:

    *   ``method='gcn'`` Normalizes the adjacency matrix for the GCN algorithm.
        This implements the linearized convolution of Eq. 8 in [1].
    *   ``method='chebyshev'``: Implements the approximate spectral convolution
        operator by implementing the k-th order Chebyshev expansion of Eq. 5 in [1].
    *   ``method='sgc'``: This replicates the k-th order smoothed adjacency matrix
        to implement the Simplified Graph Convolutions of Eq. 8 in [2].
    *   ``method='self_loops'`` or ``method='gat'``: Simply sets the diagonal elements
        of the adjacency matrix to one, effectively adding self-loops to the graph. This is
        used by the GAT algorithm of [3].
    *   ``method='ppnp'`` Calculates the personalized page rank matrix of Eq 2 in [4].

    Example::

        G_generator = FullBatchNodeGenerator(G)
        train_data_gen = G_generator.flow(node_ids, node_targets)

        # Fetch the data from train_data_gen, and feed into a Keras model:
        x_inputs, y_train = train_data_gen[0]
        model.fit(x=x_inputs, y=y_train)

        # Alternatively, use the generator itself with model.fit_generator:
        model.fit_generator(train_gen, epochs=num_epochs, ...)

            Chebyshev series order for the 'chebyshev' method. In both cases this
            should be positive integer.
        transform (callable): an optional function to apply on features and adjacency matrix
            the function takes (features, Aadj) as arguments.

            if False a dense adjacency matrix is used.
