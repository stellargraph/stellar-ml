class StellarGraph(metaclass=StellarGraphFactory):
    """
    StellarGraph class for directed or undirected graph ML models. It stores both
    graph structure and features for machine learning.

    To create a StellarGraph object ready for machine learning, at a
    minimum pass the graph structure to the StellarGraph as a NetworkX
    graph:

    For undirected models::

        Gs = StellarGraph(nx_graph)


    For directed models::

        Gs = StellarDiGraph(nx_graph)


    To create a StellarGraph object with node features, supply the features
    as a numeric feature vector for each node.

    To take the feature vectors from a node attribute in the original NetworkX
    graph, supply the attribute name to the ``node_features`` argument::

        Gs = StellarGraph(nx_graph, node_features="feature")


    where the nx_graph contains nodes that have a "feature" attribute containing
    the feature vector for the node. All nodes of the same type must have
    the same size feature vectors.

    Alternatively, supply the node features as Pandas DataFrame objects with
    the of the DataFrame set to the node IDs. For graphs with a single node
    type, you can supply the DataFrame object directly to StellarGraph::

        node_data = pd.DataFrame(
            [feature_vector_1, feature_vector_2, ..],
            index=[node_id_1, node_id_2, ...])
        Gs = StellarGraph(nx_graph, node_features=node_data)

    For graphs with multiple node types, provide the node features as Pandas
    DataFrames for each type separately, as a dictionary by node type.
    This allows node features to have different sizes for each node type::

        node_data = {
            node_type_1: pd.DataFrame(...),
            node_type_2: pd.DataFrame(...),
        }
        Gs = StellarGraph(nx_graph, node_features=node_data)


    You can also supply the node feature vectors as an iterator of `node_id`
    and feature vector pairs, for graphs with single and multiple node types::

        node_data = zip([node_id_1, node_id_2, ...],
            [feature_vector_1, feature_vector_2, ..])
        Gs = StellarGraph(nx_graph, node_features=node_data)


    Args:
        graph: The NetworkX graph instance.
        node_type_name: str, optional (default=globals.TYPE_ATTR_NAME)
            This is the name for the node types that StellarGraph uses
            when processing heterogeneous graphs. StellarGraph will
            look for this attribute in the nodes of the graph to determine
            their type.

        node_type_default: str, optional (default=globals.NODE_TYPE_DEFAULT)
            This is the default node type to use for nodes that do not have
            an explicit type.

        edge_type_name: str, optional (default=globals.TYPE_ATTR_NAME)
            This is the name for the edge types that StellarGraph uses
            when processing heterogeneous graphs. StellarGraph will
            look for this attribute in the edges of the graph to determine
            their type.

        edge_type_default: str, optional (default=globals.EDGE_TYPE_DEFAULT)
            This is the default edge type to use for edges that do not have
            an explicit type.

        node_features: str, dict, list or DataFrame optional (default=None)
            This tells StellarGraph where to find the node feature information
            required by some graph models. These are expected to be
            a numeric feature vector for each node in the graph.
