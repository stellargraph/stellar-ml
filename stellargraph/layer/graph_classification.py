    """
    A graph convolutional Keras layer. A stack of such layers can be used to create a model for supervised graph
    classification.

    The implementation is based on the GCN Keras layer of keras-gcn github
    repo https://github.com/tkipf/keras-gcn

    Notes:
      - The inputs are tensors with a batch dimension.

      - There are 2 inputs required, the node features and the normalized graph adjacency matrices for each batch entry.

      - This class assumes that the normalized graph adjacency matrices are passed as input to the Keras methods.

    Args:
        units (int): dimensionality of output feature vectors
        activation (str): nonlinear activation applied to layer's output to obtain output features
        use_bias (bool): toggles an optional bias

        kernel_initializer (str or func, optional): The initialiser to use for the weights of each graph
            convolutional layer.
        kernel_regularizer (str or func, optional): The regulariser to use for the weights of each graph
            convolutional layer.
        kernel_constraint (str or func, optional): The constraint to use for the weights of each layer graph

class GCNSupervisedGraphClassification:
    """
    A stack of :class:`GraphClassificationConvolution` layers together with a Keras `GlobalAveragePooling1D` layer
    that implement a supervised graph classification network using the GCN convolution operator
    (https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907).

    The model minimally requires specification of the GCN layer sizes as a list of ints
    corresponding to the feature dimensions for each hidden layer,
    activation functions for each hidden layers, and a generator object.

    To use this class as a Keras model, the features and pre-processed adjacency matrix
    should be supplied using the :class:`GraphGenerator` class.

    Examples:
        Creating a graph classification model from a list of :class:`StellarGraph`
        objects (``graphs``). We also add two fully connected dense layers using the last one for binary classification
        with `softmax` activation::

            training.
        bias (bool, optional): toggles an optional bias in graph convolutional layers.
        dropout (float, optional): dropout rate applied to input features of each GCN layer.
        kernel_initializer (str or func, optional): The initialiser to use for the weights of each graph
            convolutional layer.
