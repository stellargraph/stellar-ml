    Notes:
      - The inputs are tensors with a batch dimension of 1:
        Keras requires this batch dimension, and for full-batch methods
        we only have a single "batch".

      - There are three inputs required, the node features, the output
        indices (the nodes that are to be selected in the final layer)
        and the normalized graph Laplacian matrix

      - This class assumes that the normalized Laplacian matrix is passed as
        input to the Keras methods.

      - The output indices are used when ``final_layer=True`` and the returned outputs
        are the final-layer features for the nodes indexed by output indices.

      - If ``final_layer=False`` all the node features are output in the same ordering as
        given by the adjacency matrix.

    The model minimally requires specification of the fully connected layer sizes as a list of ints
    corresponding to the feature dimensions for each hidden layer,
    activation functions for each hidden layers, and a generator object.

    To use this class as a Keras model, the features and pre-processed adjacency matrix
    should be supplied using either the :class:`FullBatchNodeGenerator` class for node inference
    or the :class:`FullBatchLinkGenerator` class for link inference.

    To have the appropriate pre-processing the generator object should be instanciated
    with the `method='gcn'` argument.

    Example:
        Building an APPNP node model::

            generator = FullBatchNodeGenerator(G, method="gcn")
            ppnp = APPNP(
                layer_sizes=[64, 64, 1],
                activations=['relu', 'relu', 'relu'],
                generator=generator,
                dropout=0.5
            )
            x_in, x_out = ppnp.build()

    Notes:
      - The inputs are tensors with a batch dimension of 1. These are provided by the \
        :class:`FullBatchNodeGenerator` object.

      - This assumes that the normalized Laplacian matrix is provided as input to
        Keras methods. When using the :class:`FullBatchNodeGenerator` specify the
        ``method='gcn'`` argument to do this pre-processing.

      - The nodes provided to the :class:`FullBatchNodeGenerator.flow` method are
        used by the final layer to select the predictions for those nodes in order.
        However, the intermediate layers before the final layer order the nodes
        in the same way as the adjacency matrix.

      - The size of the final fully connected layer must be equal to the number of classes to predict.

    Args:
        layer_sizes (list of int): list of output sizes of fully connected layers in the stack
        activations (list of str): list of activations applied to each fully connected layer's output
        generator (FullBatchNodeGenerator): an instance of FullBatchNodeGenerator class constructed on the graph of interest
        bias (bool): toggles an optional bias in fully connected layers
        dropout (float): dropout rate applied to input features of each layer
        kernel_regularizer (str): normalization applied to the kernels of fully connetcted layers
