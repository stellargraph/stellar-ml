The vanilla gradients may not work well for the graph setting. The main reason is that when you compute the vanilla gradients,
you only get the direction of changing at the current state of the graph (i.e., the adjacency matrix and feature matrix). However,
even though the feature values and entries in the adjacency matrix are not continous values, the model (e.g., GCN or GAT) learns
a continous function which may not be linear when a feature or edge value changes discretely. Let's take ReLU(x) as an example, when x
changes from 0 to 1, the output of the function changes from 0 to 1 as well. However, when you compute the gradient of the function
at x = 0, you will get grad(ReLU(x = 0)) = 0 which is obviously not what we want.

Integrated gradients approximates Shapley values by integrating partial gradients w.r.t input features from reference input to the
actual input. Therefore, it could solve the problem we described above and give much better accuracy. It was initially proposed in the paper
"Axiomatic attribution for deep neuron networks" published in ICML'17.
