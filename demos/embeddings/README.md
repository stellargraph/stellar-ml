## Representation Learning Examples

This folder contains two [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) python notebooks demonstrating the combined use of 
`stellargraph` (this library) and `Gensim` [4] libraries for representation learning on homogeneous and 
heterogeneous graphs. The two notebooks demonstrate the following algorithms,

- `stellargraph-node2vec.ipynb` The **Node2Vec** algorithm [2] for representation learning on homogeneous graphs
- `stellargraph-metapath2vec.ipynb` The **Metapath2Vec** algorithm [1] for representation learning on heterogeneous graphs.

Both examples demonstrate how to calculate embedding vectors for a graph's nodes in just a few lines of Python code. 
The learned node representations can be used in numerous downstream tasks such as node attribute inference, link
prediction, and community detection.
