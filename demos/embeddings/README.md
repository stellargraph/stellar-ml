## Representation Learning Examples

This folder contains three [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) python notebooks demonstrating the use of unsupervised graph representation learning methods implemented in the `stellargraph` library for homogeneous and hetrogenous graphs with or without node features. The original works are referenced below. 

**Node2Vec** and **Metapath2Vec** notebooks demonstrate the combined use of `stellargraph` and `Gensim` [4] libraries for representation learning on homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs. 
**Unsupervised GraphSAGE** notebook demonstrates the use of `Stellargraph` library's GraphSAGE implementation for unsupervised learning of node embeddings for homogeneous graphs with node features.

The notebooks demonstrate the following algorithms.
- `stellargraph-node2vec.ipynb` The **Node2Vec** algorithm [1] for representation learning on homogeneous graphs
- `stellargraph-metapath2vec.ipynb` The **Metapath2Vec** algorithm [2] for representation learning on heterogeneous graphs.
- `embeddings-unsupervised-graphsage-cora.ipynb` The **Unsupervised GraphSAGE** algorithm [5] for representation learning on homogeneous graphs with node features.

All examples demonstrate how to calculate embedding vectors for a graph's nodes in just a few lines of Python code. 
The learned node representations can be used in numerous downstream tasks such as node attribute inference, link
prediction, and community detection.
