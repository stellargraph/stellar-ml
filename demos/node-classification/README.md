## Table of Contents

This folder contains several examples of applying graph machine learning (ML) algorithms on network-structured
data to solve node attribute inference (inferring entity properties) problems. The
examples demonstrate using the `StellarGraph` library to build machine learning
workflows on both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks.

Each folder contains one or more examples of using the StellarGraph implementations of the
state-of-the-art algorithms, attri2vec[4], GraphSAGE [3], HinSAGE, GCN [6], GAT [7], SGC [9], Node2Vec [1], and Metapath2Vec [2].
GraphSAGE, HinSAGE, and GAT are variants of Graph Convolutional Neural networks [6]. Node2Vec and
Metapath2Vec are methods based on graph random walks and representation learning using the
Word2Vec [5] algorithm. attri2vec[4] is also based on graph random walks, and learns node
representations by performing a mapping on node attributes.

The examples folder structure is shown below.
