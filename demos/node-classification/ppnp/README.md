# PPNP and APPNP for Node Classification

This is an example of using the Personalized Propogation of Neural Predictions (PPNP) and Approximate PPNP (APPNP)
algorithms [1] for semi-supervised node classification in a homogeneous network.

## Requirements
All examples use Python 3.6 and the StellarGraph library. To install the StellarGraph library
follow the instructions at: https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph

Additional requirements are Pandas, Numpy, Keras, and Scikit-Learn which are installed as depdendencies
of the StellarGraph library.
