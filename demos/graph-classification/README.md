# Graph classification using StellarGraph

[StellarGraph](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph) allows for doing graph classification.

A graph classification task predicts an attribute of about each graph in a collection of graphs. For instance, labelling each graph with a categorical class (binary classification or multiclass classification), or predicting a continuous number (regression). It is supervised or semi-supervised, where the model is trained using a subset of graphs that have ground-truth labels.
