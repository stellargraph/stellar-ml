# Link Prediction demo

This demo runs link prediction on a homogeneous or heterogeneous graph. When
the graph is heterogeneous, it can optionally be treated as homogeneous for representation learning; in
this case, the link prediction script can be thought of as a baseline for more advanced
algorithms that do not simplify the input graph.

## Requirements
This example assumes the `stellargraph` library and its requirements have been
installed by following the installation instructions in the README
of the library's [root directory](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph).
