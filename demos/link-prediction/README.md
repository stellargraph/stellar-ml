## Table of Contents

This folder contains several examples of applying graph machine learning (ML) algorithms on network-structured
data to solve link prediction (predicting relations and/or their properties) problems. The
examples demonstrate using the `StellarGraph` library to build machine learning
workflows on both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks.

Each folder contains one or more examples of using the StellarGraph implementations of the
state-of-the-art algorithms, attri2vec [4], GraphSAGE [3], HinSAGE, GCN [6], GAT [7], Node2Vec [1], and Metapath2Vec [2].
GraphSAGE, HinSAGE, and GAT are variants of Graph Convolutional Neural networks [6]. Node2Vec and
Metapath2Vec are methods based on graph random walks and representation learning using the
Word2Vec [5] algorithm. attri2vec[4] is also based on graph random walks and learns node
representations by performing a mapping on node attributes.

The examples folder structure is shown below.

* [`/random-walks`](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/tree/master/demos/link-prediction/random-walks)

    Examples of semi-supervised link prediction for homogeneous and heterogeneous networks,
    using the Node2Vec and Metapath2vec algorithms.

* [`/graphsage`](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/tree/master/demos/link-prediction/graphsage)

    Example of semi-supervised link prediction for a homogeneous network with attributed nodes,
    using the GraphSAGE algorithm.

* [`/hinsage`](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/tree/master/demos/link-prediction/hinsage)

    Example of supervised link attribute prediction for a heterogeneous network with attributed nodes of different types,
    using the HinSAGE algorithm.

* [`/attri2vec`](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/tree/master/demos/link-prediction/attri2vec)

    Example of link prediction for out-of-sample nodes for a homogeneous network with attributed nodes,
    using the attri2vec algorithm.
