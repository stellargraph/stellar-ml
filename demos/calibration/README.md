## Ensemble learning for graph neural network algorithms

This folder contains two [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) python notebooks demonstrating `StellarGraph` model calibration
for binary (`calibration-pubmed-link-prediction.ipynb`) and multi-class
classification (`calibration-pubmed-node-classification.ipynb`) problems.


## Dataset

### Pubmed-Diabetes

The examples in this directory use the Pubmed-Diabetes dataset.

The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://linqs-data.soe.ucsc.edu/public/Pubmed-Diabetes.tgz).

The following is the description of the dataset:
> The Pubmed Diabetes dataset consists of 19717 scientific publications from PubMed database pertaining to diabetes
> classified into one of three classes. The citation network consists of 44338 links. Each publication in the dataset
> is described by a TF/IDF weighted word vector from a dictionary which consists of 500 unique words.

Download and unzip the [Pubmed-Diabetes.tgz](https://linqs-data.soe.ucsc.edu/public/Pubmed-Diabetes.tgz) file to a
location on your computer and set the corresponding variable in the notebook to point to this directory.
